# Pic Your Landmark

The goal of this project was to create a native app that allows users to visit famous landmarks and take pictures on their phone within a certain distance (1 mile). Users can gain points/gems based on how many landmarks they have 'collected' and show them off to their friends and family. We used react-native-expo as our primary front-end framework and the Django API for backend.
