# Pic Your Landmark

Pic Your Landmark is a native app based on the famous game 'Pokemon Go' - except our users can 'collect' famous landmarks! When a user visits a landmark, they can take and store their picture in our app. Users gain points/gems based on how many landmarks they have 'collected'. They can show off their status as well as collection of photos to their friends and family.
